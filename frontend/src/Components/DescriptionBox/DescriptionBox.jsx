      An e-commerce website is an online platform that allows businesses to sell products or services over the internet. It enables customers to browse items, make purchases, and complete transactions from anywhere using a computer or smartphone. E-commerce sites simplify shopping by offering convenience, a wide range of products, and secure payment options.
      <p>
      An e-commerce website is a digital storefront where businesses and individuals can buy and sell goods or services online. Unlike physical stores, it operates entirely on the internet, providing users with access to products across various categories at any time. These websites often include features like shopping carts, online payment systems, and customer support. E-commerce platforms make it easier for sellers to reach a global audience and for buyers to shop conveniently from their homes.
